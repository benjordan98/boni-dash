# Student Meal Voucher Usage

An episode in my pending visualisation mini-series. This episode visualises data acquired from myself and a handful of friends using the Student Meal scheme on my exchange in Ljubljana slovenia. It uses streamlit to create the Streamlit to creast and host the mini app and pandas for most of the data manipulation.

### Hello

At the time of writing this code it was impossible to change the name of the main Streamlit file - I remember it being painful at the time so I will leave it as Hello. Fortunately, this is not too far from its intended purpose. It introduces the data app and allows the user to select who they like to view.

### Dashboard

For the selected user a series of graphs and summary statistics are displayed.

### Journey

Shows a dynamic stacked bar chart by day and count of restaurant visits straified by restraunt name.

### Comparison

Compares all members statistics in the form of a few high level results and a few plots.

### Horse Race

Shows a rotate stacked bar chart by each member visualising a race of who will use the most Boni vouchers.
